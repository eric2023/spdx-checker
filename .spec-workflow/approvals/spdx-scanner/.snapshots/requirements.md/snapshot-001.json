The tool will automatically scan project source code files, identify missing or incorrect SPDX license declarations, and provide functionality to automatically correct and complete them according to UnionTech's open source code declaration requirements.\n\nThe SPDX scanner will help ensure compliance with open source licensing requirements by maintaining proper license declarations in all source code files, reducing manual effort and potential legal risks associated with incorrect or missing license information.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis tool supports the goal of maintaining high-quality, compliant open source software by automating the tedious process of license declaration management. It ensures that all source code files contain proper SPDX license identifiers, copyright notices, and project information as required by UnionTech's standards and broader open source community practices.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: Automatic SPDX License Detection\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tool to automatically detect existing SPDX license declarations in source code files, so that I can identify which files need license information added or corrected.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the tool scans a directory THEN it SHALL identify all source code files based on file extensions (.js, .ts, .py, .java, .cpp, .c, .h, .go, .rs, etc.)\n2. WHEN processing each file THEN it SHALL parse and extract existing SPDX license information including License-Identifier, Copyright notices, and project attribution\n3. WHEN a file contains SPDX declarations THEN it SHALL validate the format and completeness according to SPDX specification v2.2+\n4. WHEN SPDX information is malformed or incomplete THEN it SHALL flag the file for correction with specific error details\n5. WHEN scanning completes THEN it SHALL generate a detailed report showing files with missing, invalid, or complete SPDX declarations\n\n### Requirement 2: License Declaration Correction and Completion\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tool to automatically correct and complete missing or incorrect SPDX license declarations, so that I can ensure compliance without manual editing of each file.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a file lacks SPDX license information THEN it SHALL add appropriate license header based on project configuration and file type\n2. WHEN existing SPDX declarations are incorrect THEN it SHALL replace them with corrected versions while preserving existing copyright information where appropriate\n3. WHEN correcting declarations THEN it SHALL maintain file encoding and line ending consistency\n4. WHEN adding new declarations THEN it SHALL place them at the appropriate location (top of file, after shebang, etc.) based on language conventions\n5. WHEN multiple correction options exist THEN it SHALL provide configurable templates for different license types and project requirements\n\n### Requirement 3: Configuration and Customization\n\n**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to configure the tool to match my project's specific license requirements and coding standards, so that it generates declarations that fit our project's needs.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the tool starts THEN it SHALL read configuration from spdx-scanner.config.json or command-line arguments\n2. WHEN configuration specifies default license THEN it SHALL use that license for files without existing declarations\n3. WHEN project-specific templates are provided THEN it SHALL use custom templates for license header generation\n4. WHEN file patterns are specified in configuration THEN it SHALL include/exclude files based on glob patterns\n5. WHEN different license requirements exist for different directories THEN it SHALL support directory-specific configuration overrides\n\n### Requirement 4: Batch Processing and Reporting\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want to process multiple files and receive comprehensive reports about the changes made, so that I can review and verify the corrections before committing them.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN processing multiple files THEN it SHALL support dry-run mode to preview changes without modifying files\n2. WHEN changes are made THEN it SHALL generate detailed logs showing before/after comparison for each modified file\n3. WHEN processing completes THEN it SHALL provide summary statistics (total files, corrected files, errors, etc.)\n4. WHEN errors occur during processing THEN it SHALL continue processing other files and report all errors at the end\n5. WHEN report generation is requested THEN it SHALL support multiple output formats (JSON, HTML, Markdown, plain text)\n\n### Requirement 5: Integration and CLI Interface\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate the tool into my development workflow and CI/CD pipelines, so that license compliance is automatically maintained.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN invoked from command line THEN it SHALL provide clear help documentation and usage examples\n2. WHEN running in CI/CD environment THEN it SHALL return appropriate exit codes (0 for success, non-zero for errors/warnings)\n3. WHEN integrated with Git hooks THEN it SHALL support pre-commit checking and automatic correction\n4. WHEN processing large codebases THEN it SHALL support parallel processing for improved performance\n5. WHEN used in different environments THEN it SHALL be compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each module should handle one aspect (scanning, parsing, correction, reporting)\n- **Modular Design**: Core functionality should be library-based with CLI as thin wrapper\n- **Dependency Management**: Minimize external dependencies, prioritize standard library usage\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean APIs between scanner, parser, corrector, and reporter components\n\n### Performance\n- **Scanning Speed**: Process 1000 files per second on modern hardware\n- **Memory Usage**: Stay under 100MB for typical project sizes (< 10k files)\n- **Parallel Processing**: Utilize available CPU cores for batch operations\n- **Incremental Updates**: Support incremental scanning to skip unchanged files\n\n### Security\n- **File Safety**: Never modify files without explicit user consent or dry-run preview\n- **Backup Creation**: Optionally create backups before modifying files\n- **Path Traversal**: Prevent directory traversal attacks when processing user-provided paths\n- **Safe Defaults**: Conservative defaults that minimize risk of data loss\n\n### Reliability\n- **Error Recovery**: Gracefully handle malformed files and continue processing\n- **Validation**: Thoroughly validate SPDX syntax and semantics\n- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage including edge cases\n- **Logging**: Detailed error messages with file paths and line numbers\n\n### Usability\n- **Clear Output**: User-friendly progress indicators and status messages\n- **Configuration Validation**: Clear error messages for invalid configuration\n- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README with examples and troubleshooting\n- **IDE Integration**: Support for popular IDEs through plugins or extensions",
